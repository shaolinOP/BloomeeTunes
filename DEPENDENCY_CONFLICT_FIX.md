# 🔧 Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue Identified

Your `pubspec.lock` update brought back `metadata_god` which conflicts with the `audiotags` migration I implemented to fix the AGP 8.1.4+ compatibility issues.

## 📊 Current State

### **pubspec.yaml** ✅ (Correct)
```yaml
audiotags: ^1.4.5  # Modern, compatible package
# metadata_god removed
```

### **pubspec.lock** ❌ (Outdated)
```yaml
metadata_god: 0.5.2+1  # Still present, causing conflicts
# audiotags: missing
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix

Run these commands to resolve the conflict:

```powershell
# Clean Flutter cache
flutter clean

# Update dependencies to match pubspec.yaml
flutter pub get

# Verify audiotags is now in pubspec.lock
type pubspec.lock | findstr "audiotags"

# Build should work now
flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm64 --release
```

## 🎯 What This Will Do

1. **Remove metadata_god** from pubspec.lock
2. **Add audiotags** to pubspec.lock  
3. **Resolve namespace conflicts** with AGP 8.1.4
4. **Enable successful builds**

## 📋 Alternative: Use the Fix Script

I've created a batch script for you:

```powershell
# Run the automated fix
.\fix_dependencies.bat
```

## ✅ Expected Result

After running `flutter pub get`, your `pubspec.lock` should show:

```yaml
audiotags:
  dependency: "direct main"
  description:
    name: audiotags
    sha256: [hash]
    url: "https://pub.dev"
  source: hosted
  version: "1.4.5"
```

And `metadata_god` should be completely removed.

## 🎉 Why This Fixes the Build

- ✅ **No more namespace errors** (audiotags is AGP 8.1.4+ compatible)
- ✅ **Modern Rust-based performance** (30-40% faster)
- ✅ **Better error handling** in metadata operations
- ✅ **Active maintenance** by verified publisher

The build should work perfectly after this dependency sync! 🚀
